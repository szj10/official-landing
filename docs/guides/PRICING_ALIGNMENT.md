# Pricing Alignment (Huavoi Landing + Studio)

Cross-repo checklist for keeping pricing pages and copy aligned between **official-landing** and **studio-web**.

- `docs/guides/SHARED_I18N_CHECKLIST.md` — locale codes, glossary, i18n engineering
- `docs/guides/TRANSLATION_GUIDE.md` — translation principles per repo

**Pages:**

| Repo             | Path                               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| official-landing | `src/app/pricing/page.tsx`         |
| studio-web       | `src/app/(shell)/pricing/page.tsx` |

**Translation files:** `public/locales/{locale}/pricing.json` (8 locales in both repos)

---

## Current state (updated after P0 + P1 + P2 + P3 pass)

### What matches (both repos)

- Tier names on plan cards: **Free / Pro / Premium** (Landing also has **Enterprise** — marketing-only)
- Price points: Free $0; Pro $49/$39; Premium $199/$159 (monthly/annual)
- **Annual billing UX**: `$39/mo` + “billed annually” + strikethrough `$49/mo when billed monthly` (paid tiers)
- **Credits model**: 5 / 25 / 100 per month with rollover caps 10 / 50 / unlimited
- Voice limits: Free 2, Pro 5, Premium 10 custom voices
- Video quality ladder: 720p → 1080p → 4K
- Pro is the highlighted / “most popular” tier
- Premium description: maximum capacity (100 credits/month — not unlimited)
- Landing prices live in `pricing.json` (no hardcoded numbers in `page.tsx`)
- Landing compare table uses correct tier keys (`free` / `pro` / `premium` / `enterprise`)
- **FAQ**: identical 6-question set (`faq.q1`–`faq.q6`) in all 8 locales — credits, rollover, plan changes, team plans, video formats, own scripts/voices. No free-trial or refund copy.
- **Feature keys**: semantic schema shared for free/pro/premium (`features.credits`, `features.rollover`, …) — documented in `SHARED_I18N_CHECKLIST.md`

### Intentional differences

| Area              | official-landing                                            | studio-web                                            |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Tier count        | 4 (Enterprise marketing-only)                               | 3                                                     |
| Compare table     | Yes                                                         | No                                                    |
| Marketing CTAs    | All tiers → `NEXT_PUBLIC_SIGNUP_URL` (Enterprise → contact) | Upgrade → checkout API (or coming-soon toast)         |
| Free tier CTA     | “Get Started” → signup URL                                  | “Get Started” (logged out) / “Current Plan” (on Free) |
| Extra sections    | Compare table, custom-solution CTA, Enterprise tier         | —                                                     |
| Surface-only keys | `subtitle`, `cta`, `monthly`/`annual`                       | `description`, `button`, `billingToggle`              |

### Checkout wiring (P4)

- **Landing** tier CTAs (Free / Pro / Premium) → `NEXT_PUBLIC_SIGNUP_URL`; Enterprise → `/about#connect-with-us`
- **Studio** upgrade buttons call `POST /billing/checkout-session` when `NEXT_PUBLIC_BILLING_ENABLED=true`; otherwise shows an info toast
- **Studio** unauthenticated users → `/signup`

### Still blocked on backend

- Stripe / `POST /billing/checkout-session` must return `{ checkout_url }` before setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_BILLING_ENABLED=true`

---

## Alignment to-do

### P0 — Fix correctness bugs (Landing)

- [x] **Compare table column headers use missing i18n keys**
- [x] **Compare table tier names match plan cards**
- [x] **Replace placeholder contact email** — Enterprise CTA → `/about#connect-with-us`

### P1 — Single source of truth for pricing model

- [x] **Unify billing unit: credits** — Landing copy & compare table updated to Studio credits model
- [x] **Align feature lists per tier** — Free/Pro/Premium features match tier matrix
- [x] **Move hardcoded prices out of Landing `page.tsx`** — prices in `pricing.json`

---

### P2 — Structural / product alignment

- [x] **Enterprise tier** — Landing-only (marketing). Studio stays 3 tiers. Documented here.
- [x] **Annual billing UX** — Landing now matches Studio (strikethrough + “billed annually”)
- [x] **FAQ alignment** — 6 canonical FAQs merged on both surfaces; free-trial and refund copy removed
- [x] **Sections only on Landing** — compare table, custom-solution CTA stay Landing-only (free-trial CTA removed)

---

### P3 — i18n engineering alignment

- [x] **Shared `pricing.json` key schema**  
      Feature keys unified to semantic names (`credits`, `rollover`, `voices`, …). FAQ keys unified (`faq.q1`–`faq.q6`). Schema documented in `SHARED_I18N_CHECKLIST.md`.

- [x] **Glossary updates**  
      Credits, rollover, and tier naming added to both `TRANSLATION_GUIDE.md` files and `SHARED_I18N_CHECKLIST.md`.

- [x] **All 8 locales in sync (Landing)** — `pricing.json` updated for en, zh-CN, zh-TW, ja, ko, de, fr, es
- [x] **All 8 locales in sync (both repos)** — FAQ, feature keys, and pricing copy aligned across all locales

---

### P4 — CTA / funnel alignment

- [x] **Signup vs upgrade flow**  
      Landing all tiers → `NEXT_PUBLIC_SIGNUP_URL`. Studio upgrade → checkout API (gated by `NEXT_PUBLIC_BILLING_ENABLED`) with coming-soon toast fallback.

- [x] **Free tier CTA**  
      Landing: “Get Started”. Studio: “Get Started” when logged out, “Current Plan” when on Free (intentional surface difference, aligned tone).

## Definition of “aligned”

Pricing is aligned when:

1. Same tier names: **Free / Pro / Premium / (Enterprise)**
2. Same prices and annual discount
3. Same limits per tier (credits, voices, quality, features)
4. FAQ facts do not contradict across repos
5. Shared i18n key structure for `pricing.json`
6. Clear funnel: Landing → signup → Studio upgrade/checkout
